around the bay.(escort-other maps in this section include Route 66 and Watchpoint: Gibraltar)

<p>Eichenwalde</p>
<p>Eichenwalde is located in the middle of the black forest, the town was a sight of one of
the most famous battles during the Omnic Crisis. On this very map the leader of the crusaders,
Balderich von Adler, and a handful of his best soldiers made a last stand against an 
advancing automaton army. They weren't enough however the german military was able to stop
the Omnic Crisis. After Eichenwalde was left abandoned, and the forest has slowly begun overtaking the village.
But the scars of the battles will not fade or go away.(hybrid-other maps in this section include
Hollywood, King's Row, and NUmbani)

<p>Ilios</p>

Situated atop a small island rising from the Aegean Sea, Ilios is a postcard-perfect Mediterranean
town, with a bustling harbor side. Great for exploring as ruins are scattered at the top of the
island, where many artifacts and relics of the ancient world have been recently unearthed.

    take or defend point all over the map. Both teams fight for control of the point the goal

    <p>Hybrid</p>
    <p>The hybrid Game mode starts as control and once the attacking team takes the point, they
    start to escort the payload. Both of these parts are a Game mode but for hybrid they are
    combined.</p>

    <p>Control</p>
    <p>On control maps two teams fight for control of a point, it is a best of three so there
    can be a total of three fights per game. Which ever team gets to 100% first wins the round. 
    Who ever wins two wins the game.</p>
